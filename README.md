Societate
=========
(SOH-she-TATE)

A social network of the people, by the people, for the people. "Societate"
means "our society" in Latin, at least according to Google Translate
(caveat pronunciatus).

Existing social networks are very enjoyable, yet the experience is tinged
somewhat by the uneasy realization that the information is being datamined
and sold to third parties, and that a corporate entity has full access to
everything that's shared.

However, it doesn't need to be this way. Simply by combining blogs, PGP, and
real social networks, we can build a social network that is fully distributed,
and one where you know exactly who gets to see your posts.

More to come.
